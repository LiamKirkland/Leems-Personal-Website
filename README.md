If there are any egregious spelling or grammar errors in my code/website/commits... Ignore them pls. I type faster than I can think sometimes and I don't notice my mess-ups.

### Disclaimer
I made it a point of this project to do as much of it as I could completely independent. I did Google how to do certain smaller things (like comparing partial matches between arrays) but for the big picture stuff I wanted to see what I could do by myself. It was definitely a challenge and I know for a fact much of the code can likely be optimized by grabbing snippets from Stackoverflow or similar resources. I felt that went against the spirit of this project which is to apply what we've learned and try to build something ourselves. So just keep that in mind (and maybe get your favorite emotional support toy/animal) before looking at the code 😅

### Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe was the thing that took up most of my time. I wanted to build something that was a bit more challenging than a silly button or slide-show. I purposefully made it harder by making it a 2-pannel game to see what sorta things I could do with it. I actually had quite a lot of fun puzzling all of the logic together, even if the logic is a bit sloppy. It gets the job done.
